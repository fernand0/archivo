Fifteen Minutes of Fame: The Dynamics of Information Access on the Web
<br />
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0505087">Fifteen Minutes of Fame: The Dynamics of Information Access on the Web</a>. The idea is simple: to check visitors behaviour in a news portal. The discovery is that the decay of visits to a news item follows a powerlaw instead of an exponential law: most of the news items get a very reduced number of visits after 36 hour.

I'm not very sure (and I don't know whether this is the case of this portal or not) but I think this has something to do with the bad usability of this kind of sites, in particular for the access to the archive (no permalinks, change of links for archiving, ...)
