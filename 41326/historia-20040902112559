Intesting reading on edu-blogging

The text is <a href="http://www.educause.edu/pub/er/erm04/erm0450.asp">Educational Blogging</a>, written by Stephen Downes.

On blogging:

<blockquote>
Blogging is something defined by format and process, not by content.
</blockquote>

Uses of blogging in education.

<blockquote>
First, teachers use blogs to replace the standard class Web page.
</blockquote>

Second, and often accompanying the first, instructors begin to link to Internet items that relate to their course.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Third, blogs are used to organize in-class discussions.
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
Fourth, some instructors are using blogs to organize class seminars and to provide summaries of readings.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Finally, fifth, students may be asked to write their own blogs as part of their course grade.
</blockquote>

Citing Mireille Guay:

<blockquote>
The conversation possible on the weblog is also an amazing tool to develop our community of learners
</blockquote>


Some risks:

<blockquote>
Though the company retreated, the potential for conflict between a blog writer and an institution's administration remains. In addition to posting copyrighted or protected information, students can get into trouble for libelous content.

<a href="http://diveintomark.org/">Pilgrim</a> said:

<blockquote>
Writers will write because they can't not write.  Repeat that over and over to yourself until you get it. Do you know someone like that? Someone who does what they do, not for money or glory or love or God or country, but simply because it~Rs who they are and you can~Rt imagine them being any other way?  
</blockquote>

And, of course,

<blockquote>
... writing weblogs is not for everybody
</blockquote>

Blogging for class is really blogging?
<blockquote>
What happens when a free-flowing medium such as blogging interacts with the more restrictive domains of the educational system?  
</blockquote>

Will Richardson says no: 

<blockquote> 
By its very nature, assigned blogging in schools cannot be blogging. It's contrived. No matter how much we want to spout off about the wonders of audience and readership, students who are asked to blog are blogging for an audience of one, the teacher.
</blockquote>

At the end, a very interesting note:

<blockquote>
Despite obvious appearances, blogging isn't really about writing at all; that's just the end point of the process, the outcome that occurs more or less naturally if everything else has been done right.  Blogging is about, first, reading. But more important, it is about reading what is of interest to you: your culture, your community, your ideas. And it is about engaging with the content and with the authors of what you have read-reflecting, criticizing, questioning, reacting.
