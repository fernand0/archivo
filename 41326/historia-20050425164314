Weblogs: Their Use and Application in Science and Technology Libraries

Interesting reading about the use of weblogs in libraries.
It can be downloaded from <a href="http://stlq.info/archives/blogstl.pdf"> Weblogs: Their Use and Application in Science and Technology Libraries (pdf)</a> and I saw it referenced at <a href="http://b2ob.blogspot.com/2005/04/paper-utilizao-de-weblogs-em.html">[paper] Utilização de weblogs em bibliotecas especializadas</a>.  

Some excerpts:

<blockquote>
Blogs are commonly solo projects, but are also extremely success- ful as community projects. Slashdot's "News for Nerds. Stuff That Matters" typifies the community blog, as demonstrated by its core group of authors and thousands of story-seekers who contribute news items and ideas for the site.  Essentially, weblogs allow for simplified Web publishing (Lindahl 2003).
</blockquote>

And later:


<blockquote>
Social software " . . . refers to various, loosely connected types of applica- tions that allow individuals to communicate with one another, and to track discussions across the Web as they happen" (Tepper 2003). Boyd identified three principles of social software, which he suggests paint a picture of a "bottom-up" rather than a "top-down" application of the technology. In his view, social software offers: "Support for conversational interaction be- tween individuals or groups"; "Support for social feedback"; and "Support for social networks" (Boyd, accessed December 7, 2004).
</blockquote>


And

<blockquote>
... it's about co-evolution: people in personal contact, inter- acting towards their own ends, influencing each other.
</blockquote>

I know of another paper relating weblogs and librarians but it is in Catalan: <a href="http://www-fme.upc.es/documents/jordocmat-weblogs.pdf">Weblogs: un nou espai per l'aprenentatge (pdf)</a>.
