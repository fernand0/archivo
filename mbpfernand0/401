Anque ya tiene unos años me gustó leer <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/apenwarr/diary/371.html">Git is the next Unix</a>, donde se traza un paralelismo entre el sistema operativo y el sistema de control de versiones (aunque el autor habla más bien de una plataforma):

<blockquote>
When Unix pipes were invented, suddenly it was trivially easy to do something that used to be really hard: connect the output of one program to the input of the next. Pipes were the fundamental insight that shaped the face of Unix. Programs didn't have to be monolithic.

With git, we've invented a new world where revision history, checksums, and branches don't make your filesystem slower: they make it faster. They don't make your data bigger: they make it smaller. They don't risk your data integrity; they guarantee integrity. They don't centralize your data in a big database; they distribute it peer to peer.

Much like Unix itself, git's actual software doesn't matter; it's the file format, the concepts, that change everything.
