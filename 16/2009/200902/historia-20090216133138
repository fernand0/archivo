Doce problemas de Twitter
En <a href="http://www.socialmediatoday.com/SMC/72690">The 12 Major
Problems with Twitter and The Stephen Fry Backlash</a>. Algunos son
matizables y otros no sé si son problema del Twitter o de las espectativas
de sus usuarios.

Me ha hecho gracia esto:

<blockquote>
3. YOU FEEL YOU ARE CONNECTED

You are not. I too was amazed when, after following (THE) Stephen Fry, he followed me back. I felt honoured as I then watched my fellow tweeters attempt to engage him in fawning conversations about where to get a good espresso in Tanzania. Think about it, if you are following five thousand people, if each person only twittered you once a day that would be... a pain.

It feels like a two-way connection but it's not.
</blockquote>

Y me ha dado que pensar este otro:

<blockquote>
8. TWITTER HAS A FATAL FLAW

The fact that one's followers are explicit is bonkers. One of my clients had a crazy idea - to simply follow all his competitors followers. He made a heap of additional sales that day. Is being able to see, and contact, someone's followers a fatal flaw in Twitter? I don't know but it is definitely exploitable.
</blockquote>

Aunque  creo que sería ligeramente contradictorio con el anterior.
