Encantamientos para 'muggles'
Asi se titulaba la charla de Danah Boyd en Etech, que se puede leer en <a href="http://www.danah.org/papers/Etech2007.html">Incantations for Muggles: The Role of Ubiquitous Web 2.0 Technologies in Everyday Life</a>. 

Dice cosas interesantes, aunque en mi opinión hacia el final, con el (mal) rollo de lo que le pasó a <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">Kathy Sierra</a> (amenazas y molestias varias) decae un poco.

Entresaco algunas ideas.

Sobre las herramientas construidas:

<blockquote>
We often live in a fantasy of "If you build it, they will come." This techno-centric framing can be helpful to innovation - it allows us to engage our imagination, to go beyond our wildest dreams. But if we look at what technologies are adopted and how, we start to see that they fit into a set of pre-existing practices.
</blockquote>
 
Y por qué algunas tienen éxito y otras no:

<blockquote>
Technologies succeed when they support what people already do, what they want to do, and what they're required to do. Technologies become ubiquitous when people stop thinking them as a technology and simply use them as a regular part of everyday life.
</blockquote>

Sobre las movileras:

<blockquote>
The mobile is a complete disaster.  [...] Both would benefit tremendously from social apps, but i'll save you from my rant about how carriers are destroying the world.  
</blockquote>

Intervenir o no intervenir:

<blockquote>
Should we build technology to promote what we believe should be people's priorities? Or should we build technology that supports the priorities that most people have? It's a funny conundrum and one that often has to do with the life stage of a company.
</blockquote>

Cambia nuestra forma de relacionarnos:

<blockquote>
This has dramatic consequences because it means that the underlying architecture of life has changed. Things spread far greater than we ever would've imagined. I feel really badly for the Star Wars Kid.
</blockquote>

Y sobre esas relaciones:

<blockquote>
But on a serious note - are we really building meaningful social relations through this service? Sure, we're able to keep tabs on our close friends, but what does it mean that the entire tech industry is rattling on about their every snack break and coding hiccup? Just because you have those details about Scoble's life does not mean that you're friends.
</blockquote>

Y, claro:

<blockquote>
We think it's all positive, but don't forget the Star Wars kid or the kid who got kicked out of college because of his Facebook or even the man who lost his job because of his Usenet posts. Not all outcomes of ubiquitous technology have positive outcomes.
</blockquote>
