Algunas citas citables:
<blockquote>
The Internet is still in the embryonic stages of standing on its own characteristics. Communication and content presentation strategies still mirror existing models, particularly newspaper and magazine publishing.  Email, for example, is merely an extension of existing mail systems. As such, it is about bending a new medium to an existing process.

Amén (¿o era guau?).

<blockquote>
Blogging is using a new medium for what it is good for - connecting and interacting. Blogging is a first generation tool built on, and taking advantage of, the unique attributes of the Internet.

Amén.

<blockquote>
"But what bloggers do is completely new - and cannot be replicated on any other medium. It's somewhere in between writing a column and talk radio.  It's genuinely new. And it harnesses the web's real genius - its ability to empower anyone to do what only a few in the past could genuinely pull off.  In that sense, blogging is the first journalistic model that actually harnesses rather than merely exploits the true democratic nature of the web. It's a new medium finally finding a unique voice." (Andrew Sullivan)

Mmmmm. Casi amén. No sólo periodismo, más cosas.

Beneficios:
<blockquote>
Benefits of blogging are numerous (which explains its rapid growth!). An overriding benefit is the democratization of information.
</blockquote>

¿Y esta?
<blockquote>
Fostering the fringe - ideas are evaluated based on merit - not on source of origin.
</blockquote>
Algo fundamental de la red para mi es que da exactamente igual quién seas.  Lo que importa es lo que dices/haces, y tu trayectoria.

<blockquote>
Multiple perspectives - one-sided perspectives of newspapers are replaced by passionate debates exploring virtually every facet of an idea or concept.
</blockquote>

Las barreras.
<blockquote>
Barrier elimination - society is about barriers - actual or unspoken. For example, I don't run in the same circle as Bill Gates - a socio-economic barrier (at the absolute minimum!). In society, this generally means that I do not have the benefit of Mr. Gates' wisdom...blogging, however changes that. Opportunities now exist to hear regular thoughts from people like Ray Ozzie, Mitch Kapor, and Larry Lesig.
</blockquote>

Yo no hablaría de eliminación, sino de rebajar la 'altura', pero bueno.
Ya tenemos 'The art of blogging'. 
¿Para cuando 'The zen of blogging'?
