iPads en clase
Tengo recopilados unos cuantos enlaces sobre el tema. Hay que hacer la prevención de que el iPad se puso a la venta en abril de 2010, lo que significa que ahora mismo estarán empezando el curso siguiente los primeros estudiantes que (siendo muy pioneros) han disfrutado del aparato un curso completo.

En <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/iPads-for-College-Classrooms-/126681/">iPads Could Hinder Teaching, Professors Say</a>  dicen:

<blockquote>
"I don't think the institution is going to get to decide about the uptake of these devices," Mr. Ringle says. Colleges, and their professors, will have to adapt to their students' choice whether they like it or not. That hasn't happened yet, but as more content becomes available, he is confident it will.

En <a href="http://www.mactech.com/2011/05/04/ipad-study-released-oklahoma-state-university">iPad Study Released by Oklahoma State University</a> ofrece datos poco concluyentes pero:

<blockquote>
Was the integration of the iPad an enhancement to the academic experience?  Self-report responses by pilot students indicated that 75% agreed or strongly agree with the statement, "I think the iPad enhanced the learning experience of this course." Upon more detailed review, that number jumps to 92.8% among students who owned a Mac and falls to 70.4% among students who owned a PC.

Survey results also showed only 3% of students in one course would opt out of the iPad course for an identical course which didn't include the iPad.  From a faculty perspective, the greatest benefit was having uniform hardware and software available across the class. Said differently, faculty knew all students had access to the same learning tools. This was critical when planning assignments and class activities.

En <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-Slow-Motion-Mobile-Campus/127380/">The Slow-Motion Mobile Campus</a>, algo menos de optimismo: 

<blockquote>
But the hype has outpaced the reality, to judge from the experiences of Stanford and other colleges. Getting iPads and iPhones in the hands of college students is the easy part; rebuilding campus infrastructure to support mobile devices is expensive. And as Stanford's experience shows, getting professors, students, and staff to work together to explore the educational potential of mobile devices is a slow, uneven process, more suitable in some fields than others.
</blockquote>

O sea, lo de siempre: una cosa es comprar las maquinitas, y otra adaptar las enseñanzas y el aprendizaje a ellas.

Y, usos adicionales de los apartitos, con sus pros y contras:

<blockquote>
If a college introduced a system that recorded attendance by tracking the GPS locations of students' mobile phones, it would be creepy. It would be met with complaints from privacy groups. It could violate federal law. But if students chose to install such a tracking system on their phones to get cheap eats, it would not be creepy. The source of the application matters.
