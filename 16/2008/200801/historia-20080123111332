15 principios para la web
Lo vi en casa de Julen Iturbe, en <a href="http://artesaniaenred.blogspot.com/2008/01/as-de-buena-es-tu-pgina-web.html">Any website is only as good as its worst page</a> que se centra en uno de los principios.
<br />
<br />
Se trata de una presentación de Tom Loosemore, de BBC Future Media & Technology que puede verse en <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/hvs/bbc20-the-bbcs-15-web-principles/">BBC2.0: The BBC's 15 Web Principles</a>, aunque la presentación se resume a ir mostrando los principios:
<br />
<br />

<blockquote>
Principle #1 Build web products that meet user needs: anticipate needs not yet fully articulated by users, then meet them with products that set new standards.
<br />
Principle #2 The very best websites do one thing really, really well: do less, but execute perfectly.
<br />
Principle #3 Do not attempt to do everything yourselves: link to other high-quality sites instead. Your users will thank you.  Use other people's content and tools to enhance your site, and vice versa.
<br />
Principle #4 Fall forward, fast: make many small bets, iterate wildly, back successes, kill failures, fast.
<br />
Principle #5 Treat the entire web as a creative canvas: don't restrict your creativity to your own site.
<br />
Principle #6 The web is a conversation. Join in: Adopt a relaxed, conversational tone. Admit your mistakes.
<br />
Principle #7 Any website is only as good as its worst page: Ensure best practice editorial processes are adopted and adhered to.
<br />
Principle #8 Make sure all your content can be linked to, forever.
<br />
Principle #9 Remember your granny won't ever use Second Life: She may come online soon, with very different needs from early-adopters.
<br />
#10 Maximise routes to content: Develop as many aggregations of content about people, places, topics, channels, networks & time as possible. Optimise your site to rank high in Google.
<br />
Principle #11 Consistent design and navigation needn't mean one-size-fits-all: Users should always know they're on one of your websites, even if they all look very different. Most importantly of all, they know they won't ever get lost.
<br />
Principle #12 Accessibility is not an optional extra: Sites designed that way from the ground up work better for all users.
<br />
Principle #13 Let people paste your content on the walls of their virtual homes: Encourage users to take nuggets of content away with them, with links back to your site
<br />
Principle #14 Link to discussions on the web, don't host them: Only host web-based discussions where there is a clear rationale 
<br />
Principle #15 Personalisation should be unobtrusive, elegant and transparent: After all, it's your users' data. Best respect it.
</blockquote>

Yo me quedo con el 3, el 6, el 8 (el gran olvidado en la web hispana hasta hace poco y aún en algunos casos), el 10 (claro), el 13, el 14 (interesante) y el 15. Muchos. Los demás son sensacionales también.
