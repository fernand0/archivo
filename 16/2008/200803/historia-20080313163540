Internet: las usuarias ganan
O eso dicen en <a href="http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/the_web/article3511863.ece">Girls and young women are now the most prolific web users</a>.

<blockquote>
A recent study by the Pew Internet Project in America on teens in social media found that blogging growth among teenagers is almost entirely fuelled by girls, whom it describe as a new breed of "super-communicators". Some 35% of girls, compared with 20% of boys, have blogs; 32% of girls have their own websites, against 22% of boys.

Girls have embraced social networking sites on a massive scale, with 70% of American girls aged 15-17 having built and regularly worked on a profile page on websites such as MySpace, Bebo and Facebook, as opposed to 57% of boys of the same age.
